"Intro": {
  "paragraph": "After years of grueling work, 50 brave emojis decided they were done being repetitively printed and misused on the large \"Best Friends Forever\" thread.  They decided to leave the texting world and migrated onto the Ethereum blockchain.  A transformation occurred during the migration process that randomly selected traits from over 110 options, making each emoji unique.  This process took the first 50 emojis and minted them into emOG's that live on the Ethereum blockchain as NFT's.  emOG NFT is the original generative pixel are emoji collection on the Ethereum blockchain.  After the first 50 emOG's were sucessfully minted, other emojis want to follow in their foot steps.  emOG NFT will be expanding to multiple different blockchains, each blockchain will have a maximum of 500 emOG's.",
